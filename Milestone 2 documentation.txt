Milestone 2 <version 1> and <29/10/21>
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------
Program now loads two textures, a background and a player sprite. The player sprite can be moved in 8 directions through keyboard input using WASD

Code Additions
--------------
Functions to blit based on alpha values
Functions to load in multiple textures
Ability to move player texture/sprite based on keyboard input
Error message displays if texture is missing
Deletes textures when loop is finished

Tests
-----
Moving sprite in 8 directions, cardinal and ordinal
Variable framerates depending on if program is in release of debug setting
Average of 65FPS in debug
Average of 175FPS in release
Clearing to screen removed as being used, FPS values increased significantly
Average of 100FPS in debug
Average of 300+FPS in release
Sprite unable to leave screen boundaries
Alpha blend not working correctly, was only checking against red value as code contained error meaning all channels checked against same value
Alpha blend fixed so all channels checked correctly

Notes
-----

Attempted to have multiple sprites so ship can face different directions when moving and will stay in that position
Sprite would change facing direction and hold the last position when no keyboard input was detected
Problem as there would always be a sprite facing north at the same time
Code removed until it can be fixed, sprites can still be found in the data folder
